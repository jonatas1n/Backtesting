# Backtesting
Backtesting is a freelance project for a client who is a stock exchange trader. He required the development of a platform to perform some calculations on data exported in XML files. This data would later be used to extract insights into their operations.

# Implementation
In this way, a tool was implemented in Python, using Flask for the API and for the templates. Calculations were performed using the Pandas library.
